# Usability Evaluation Report

## Notes

- No consent form
- Since distributing the app was not working, I walked through the app via Discord by sharing my screen
- Generally, I asked participants to guide me, since I was controlling the app, to create an account, make a post, and send a friend request. Then, I asked for thoughts about the app. I asked whether they would use this app and whether they felt more motivated to learn after using this app.

## User Tests

### User A

#### Type

- Student

#### Raw data

- Home button not clear
- Bugs throughout
- Confusing ordering of posts

#### Overall thoughts

- Would use the app if finished
- Likes how the app looks
- Would recommend to others
- Was more motivated, but also more depressed with themselves after seeing other posts

### User B

#### Type

- Student

#### Raw data

- Did not know how to find specific people

#### Suggestions

- Push notifications of a "fact of the day" or "learned thing of the day"
- About Me section of account creation should have a message if it is optional
- Add tags to make it easier to find others with similar interests
- Add user search
- Add replies, since they are a big reason why they would be engaged with the app

#### Overall thoughts

- No initial attraction towards using the app. However, if they continued to use it, they could see themselves being more motivated to learn.
- Noted that this could be used by teachers to help class engagement, being more interesting than turning in a homework assignment of what you learned for 5 points.

### User C

#### Type

- Student

#### Raw data

- Navigated the app as intended without much difficulty

#### Suggestions

- Add user search
- Add streaks to boost engagement/usage frequency by game-ifying posting

#### Overall thoughts

- The acronym 'TIL' conveys a very casual tone
- Thought the app's intended use case was to post about random topics learned
- Would use the app, but only to make posts of interesting things
