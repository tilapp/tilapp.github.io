# Today I Learned Usability Evaluation Design

## User Goals

- Share something you learned today
- Read a few posts from other users
- Find other users with similar interests or from the same org, or both
- Make friends with other users and see what they posted
- After using the app, you feel more motivated to learn
- You would use this app to share things you learn

## Scenarios

- Imagine you are a student who just finished a class and are on the way to your next one. You heard about this app and are trying it for the first time. Register an account using your school email and make a post about something you just learned.

- Imagine you are a student who has been using the app before. Your friend (from the same university) recently made an account and posted a few things. Find your friend's profile and send them a friend request.

## User Types

- Student

## Recruitment

- Since they are from many different schools, I can ask my friends to evaluate the app.
