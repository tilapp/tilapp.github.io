- Report bad behavior in the app

- Create an account as an organization admin

## Scenarios

- Imagine you are a student who just finished a class in Chemistry 161 and are on the way to your next one. You heard about the app and are trying it for the first time. Register an account and make a post about something you just learned.

- Imagine you are a student who has been using the app before. Your friend recently made an account. Find your friend's profile and send them a friend request.

- Imagine you are an organization and you want your members to use the app. Create a new organization with a default admin account.

## User Types

- Student
- Organization Owner

## Recruitment

- Since they are from many different schools, I can ask my friends to evaluate the app.
- Unsure if possible to get organization owners
